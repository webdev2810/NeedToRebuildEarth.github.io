                <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
                   Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions.
                   But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change,
                   primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

                   <br>
                   Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth,
                   trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.
                    <br>
                    <span>__________________________________</span>

                    <br>
                   The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane.
                   These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building,
                   for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide.
                   Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions.
                   Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.</p>

                <p>Burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests and farming livestock are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth’s temperature.
                    This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming.</p>

                    Climate scientists have showed that <br>humans are responsible for virtually <br>all global heating over the last 200 years.<br>
                    Human activities like the ones mentioned above <br>are causing greenhouse gases that are<br> warming the world faster than at <br>any time in at least the last two thousand years.<br>
                    The average temperature of the Earth’s surface <br>is now about 1.1°C warmer than it was in<br> the late 1800s (before the industrial revolution)<br> and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. <br>The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record, <br>and each of the last four decades has been<br> warmer than any previous decade since 1850.<br><br>
                    Many people think climate change mainly <br>means warmer temperatures.<br> But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story.<br> Because the Earth is a system, where everything is connected,<br> changes in one area can influence changes in all others.<br>
                    The consequences of climate change now include,<br> among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires,<br> rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice,<br> catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.</p>

                    <p>Every increase in global warming matters
                        In a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a livable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to a 2.8°C temperature rise by the end of the century.
                            
                        The emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others.The seven biggest emitters alone (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and Brazil) accounted for about half of all global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020.
                            
                        Everyone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.</p>

                        <p>As greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface temperature. The last decade, 2011-2020, is the warmest on record. Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one. Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves. Higher temperatures increase heat-related illnesses and make working outdoors more difficult. Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when conditions are hotter. Temperatures in the Arctic have warmed at least twice as fast as the global average.</p>

Cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons feed on warm waters at the ocean surface. Such storms often destroy homes and communities, causing deaths and huge economic losses.</p>
